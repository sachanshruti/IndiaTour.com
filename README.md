Traveling is an important part of human life. Tourism refers to the situation where people travel from one country or region to another region or country for a short time. Nowadays, tourism has gained importance. Our mini project aims to address these challenges by developing an integrated tourism website that offers personalised recommendations and seamless booking functionality. Leveraging data analytics and user profiling techniques, our platform will analyse user preferences, past travel behaviour, and demographic information to suggest relevant destinations, attractions, and accommodations.By partnering with local businesses and tourism boards, we will curate exclusive deals and insider tips to enhance the traveller experience and promote off-the-beaten-path destinations.The website will feature an intuitive interface that allows users to explore destinations, browse accommodations, and book activities all in one place.
